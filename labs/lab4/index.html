			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<p>Working with a partner, psuedocode tasks and break them down into simple, solvable components.</p>

			<h2>Problems and Challenges</h2>
			<p>While working, we got pretty stumped over a specific mechanic in Pokemon's battle system. In the end, it wasn't essential to the program
			itself and caused more problems than it was worth to represent.</p>
		</div>
		<div class = "topic">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here is the psuedocode for a pokemon battle! You can also look at it <a href="js/lab.js">here</a> if you'd like</p>
			<pre>
	//Pokemon Battle
		//Start Battle, place both player and enemy pokemon on screen
		//Battle Loop
		//Get Player Input
				//If “attack,” save attack data.
				//If “item,” run item usage.
				//If “flee” and is not a trainer battle, roll flee chance.
					//If the flee is successful, end the battle loop.
		//If player attack
				//Compare Player and Enemy Speeds
				//If player first, run player attack then enemy attack
				//If enemy first, run enemy attack then player attack
				//Else
				  //Run enemy attack
		//Check hp of pokemon on field, if hp 0, faint
		//Check the number of pokemon on each side, if 0 on either, end battle loop.
		//If Trainer pokemon is 0, blackout and end combat scene
		//If Opponent pokemon is 0, declare the player winner and end combat scene.
		//Else, player has fled and end combat scene.
